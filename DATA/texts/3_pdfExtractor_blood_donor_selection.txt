Donor selection
2.0. Overview
Donor selection is a critical process in the chain from a safe blood 
donation to a safe blood product with high quality. This chapter 
considers the principles for the selection of donors of whole blood and 
also donors of components obtained by different apheresis procedures.
2.1. Responsibilities of blood establishments in the 
selection process
2.1.1. Principle of voluntary non-remunerated donation
Standard
2.1.1.1.  Measures must be taken to promote the collection of blood and 
blood components from voluntary non‑remunerated donations 
according to the principles set out in the Convention for the 
Protection of Human Rights and Dignity of the Human Being with 
Regard to the Application of Biology and Medicine (Convention on 
Human Rights and Biomedicine, ETS No. 164). Further guided by the 
Council of Europe Committee on Bioethics (CD ‑BIO) Guide for the 
implementation of the principle of prohibition of financial gain with

127respect to the human body and its parts from living or deceased 
donors.*
Council of Europe Recommendation No. R (95) 14, Article 2 states that 
‘Donation is considered voluntary and non-remunerated if the person 
gives blood, plasma or cellular components of his or her own free will 
and receives no payment for it, either in the form of cash or in kind 
which could be considered a substitute for money. This would include 
time off work other than that reasonably needed for the donation and 
travel. Small tokens, refreshments and reimbursements of direct travel 
costs are compatible with voluntary, non-remunerated donation.’
2.1.2. Sex and gender 
Standard
2.1.2.1.  Blood establishments should have systems in place that 
accommodate both the gender and sex of the donor to allow 
donors to be appropriately addressed, to enable determination of 
appropriate sex ‑related biological parameters to ensure donor and 
recipient safety and to assess donor eligibility. Safety considerations 
include, for example, donor haemoglobin values, total blood 
volume estimation and pregnancy ‑related risks, including risks for 
HLA/HNA‑ antibodies (Evidence level C, E) .
The term sex is generally used to refer to physical or genetic attributes 
that comprise biological sex, including male, female or intersex, and 
is generally assigned at birth. Gender, on the other hand, refers to 
how a person identifies with the various socially constructed roles, 
behaviours, expressions and identities of girls, women, boys, men and 
gender-diverse people, including those outside of gender spectrums.
In blood donation and transfusion practice the sex/gender of donors 
and recipients has traditionally been defined as a binary variable 
based on the biological and physiological differences between male 
and female individuals.

Guide to the preparation, use and quality assurance of blood components128Accurate use of donor gender by blood establishments in both written 
records and verbal communications is necessary to allow donors 
to be appropriately addressed. Accurate knowledge of donor sex is 
necessary to determine appropriate sex-related biological parameters 
to ensure donor and recipient safety and to assess donor eligibility.
2.1.3. General requirements
Standards
2.1.3.1.  Procedures for safe donor identification, suitability interview and 
eligibility assessment must be implemented and maintained. 
They must take place before each donation and comply with the 
requirements set out in Annex II and Annex III to Directive 2004/33/
EC (Directive 2005/62/EC, Annex 6.1.1) .
2.1.3.2.  Blood establishments are ultimately responsible for the quality and 
safety of the blood and blood components collected, and must be 
entitled to decide on the final acceptance or deferral of a donor or 
a prospective donor, taking into account Resolution CM/Res (2008) 5 
on donor responsibility and on the limitations to donation of blood 
and blood components.
2.1.4.  Information to be provided to donors of blood or 
blood components
Standards
2.1.4.1.  Information must be provided to prospective donors of blood or 
blood components. This information provides the basis for informed 
consent that must be obtained from the donor before proceeding 
to donation (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex II) .
2.1.4.2.  Accurate educational materials, which are understandable for 
members of the general public, about the essential nature of blood, 
the blood donation procedure, the components derived from 
whole blood and apheresis donations and the important benefits 
to patients must be provided (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex II) .

requiring a medical assessment, health and medical history, the 
testing of donations and the significance of ‘informed consent’. 
• For allogeneic donations: self‑deferral, temporary and permanent 
deferral and the reasons why individuals must not donate blood or 
blood components if there could be a risk for the recipient or the 
donor. 
• For autologous donations: the possibility of deferral and the reasons 
why the donation procedure cannot take place in the presence of 
a health risk to the individual, whether as a donor or recipient of 
the autologous blood or blood components. (Directive 2004/33/EC 
Annex II) .
2.1.4.4.  Information on the protection of personal data: no unauthorised 
disclosure of the identity of the donor, of information concerning 
the donor’s health or of the results of the tests performed must be 
provided (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex II) .
2.1.4.5.  The reasons why individuals must not make donations that may be 
detrimental to their health must be provided (Directive 2004/33/EC, 
Annex II) .
2.1.4.6.  Specific information on the nature of the procedures involved in 
the allogeneic or autologous donation process and their respective 
associated risks must be provided. For autologous donations, 
information on the possibility that the autologous blood and 
blood components may not suffice for the intended transfusion 
requirements must be provided (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex II) .
2.1.4.7.  Information on the option for donors to change their mind about 
donating before proceeding further, or the option to withdraw or 
self‑defer at any time during the donation process without undue 
embarrassment or discomfort must be provided (Directive 2004/33/
EC, Annex II) .

agents, will result in donor deferral and destruction of the collected 
unit (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex II)  and, when required by law, that 
the results should be reported to the relevant health authorities 
must be provided.
2.1.4.12.  Information on the opportunity for donors to ask questions at any 
time must be provided (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex II) .
2.1.4.13.  All blood donors should be provided with information about 
behaviours associated with an increased risk of blood ‑borne 
infectious agents, such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis transmission, and 
be given the opportunity for self‑exclusion so that those persons 
refrain from donating.

Chapter 2 Donor selection
1312.2. Medical assessment of donors
2.2.1. Donor eligibility
Standards
2.2.1.1.  Upon arrival at the blood establishment, donors should provide 
evidence of their identity. All donors must undergo a systematic 
screening process to assess their suitability (GPG 6.1.3.) .
2.2.1.2.  There must be an area for confidential personal interviews with and 
assessment of individuals to assess their eligibility to donate. This 
area must be separated from all processing areas (Directive 2005/62/
EC, Annex 3.2) .
2.2.1.3.  There should be secure and unique identification, as well as 
recording of the contact details, of donors (GPG 6.1.2.) .
2.2.1.4.  Only healthy persons with an acceptable medical history can be 
accepted as donors of blood or blood components (GPG 6.1.4.) .
2.2.1.5.  Relevant acceptance/deferral criteria should be in place at the blood 
establishment to control acceptance and deferral of donors (GPG 
6.1.7.) .
2.2.1.6.  The selection process should include assessment of each donor 
carried out by a suitably qualified individual who has been trained to 
use accepted guidelines and who works under the responsibility of 
a physician. This assessment involves an interview, a questionnaire 
and  further direct questions, if necessary (GPG 6.1.5.) .
2.2.1.7.  Procedures should be in place to ensure that any abnormal findings 
arising from the donor selection process are properly reviewed by 
a qualified healthcare professional and that appropriate action is 
taken (GPG 6.1.13.) . 
In practice, a complete medical and physical examination of the 
donor is not possible. It is necessary to rely on the donor’s appearance, 
their answers to questions concerning their medical history, general 
Blood21.indb   131Blood21.indb   131 04/04/2023   09:25:5704/04/2023   09:25:57

Guide to the preparation, use and quality assurance of blood components132health and relevant risk factors (e.g. risk behaviour, travel history, 
epidemiological factors), and on laboratory tests.
Based on this information, a decision on the eligibility of the donor 
will be made using accepted guidelines. Conditions that are not 
covered by guidelines should be referred to the physician in charge 
with responsibility for making the final decision.
2.2.2.  Donor age
Standards
2.2.2.1.  The age limits for donation are a minimum of 18 years and maximum 
of 65 years (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex III) .
2.2.2.2.  Where allowed by national legislation, blood donation may be 
considered from donors aged 17.
2.2.2.3.  Donation by first‑time donors above the age of 60 years is at the 
discretion of the physician in the blood establishment (Directive 
2004/33/EC, Annex III) .
2.2.2.4.  Donation by donors over 65 years is with permission of the physician 
in the blood establishment, given annually (Directive 2004/33/EC, 
Annex III) . This can be given either individually to each donor, or 
based on a medical risk assessment for a given donor population.
2.2.3.  Donor haemoglobin
Standards
2.2.3.1.  Haemoglobin concentration must be determined each time the 
donor donates whole blood or cellular components (Directive 
2004/33/EC, Annex III) .
2.2.3.2.  Haemoglobin values at donation must not be lower than the values 
shown in the table below (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex III) :
Blood21.indb   132Blood21.indb   132 04/04/2023   09:25:5704/04/2023   09:25:57

Chapter 2 Donor selection
133Table 2 ‑1. Haemoglobin values
Female Male
Whole blood and 
cellular components125 g/L or 7.8 mmol/L 135 g/L or 8.4 mmol/L
Individual donations may be accepted below these levels after 
consultation with the responsible physician or as established by a 
competent authority based on norms for their specific populations.
Haemoglobin should be measured preferably before the donation, but 
always before donation when donors were deferred from donation at 
the last visit because of its low level.
Abnormally high and low haemoglobin values should be confirmed 
by full blood count and subsequently investigated, as should a fall in 
haemoglobin concentration of more than 20 g per L (1.24 mmol/L) 
between two successive donations.
2.2.4.  Iron stores
There is increasing awareness of the risk of iron deficiency following 
regular whole blood donation. This is particularly apparent in female 
donors of childbearing years, frequent whole blood donors and in 
donors with inadequate dietary iron intake who may present as a 
first-time donor with low or borderline iron stores. Each whole blood 
donation results in the loss of 200 to 250 mg of iron. Replenishment of 
this may take up to 6 months based on a normal healthy diet.
Iron deficiency may occur despite a normal pre-donation 
haemoglobin measurement.
Standard
2.2.4.1.  Blood establishments should have measures in place to minimise 
iron depletion in frequent blood donors.

--- PAGE BREAK ---
Guide to the preparation, use and quality assurance of blood components134Measures to prevent iron depletion and to protect donor health may 
include:
• Provision of materials for donor education, particularly in 
regard to the impact of blood donation on iron stores;
• Individual tailoring of donation frequency or the interval 
between donations and/or of the type of blood component 
donation based on sex, age, Hb values and iron status 
(Evidence level C, E) ;
• Use of tests to assess iron status, such as ferritin, soluble 
transferrin receptor and red blood cell (RBC) indices;
• Iron supplementation taking into account the risk of delaying 
the diagnosis of unapparent underlying diseases and adverse 
effects of the iron preparations;
• In plasmapheresis donations destined for plasma for 
fractionation: the use of samples taken from the plasma 
collection container (instead of whole blood samples from the 
donor) for mandatory laboratory screening tests in order to 
avoid a loss of iron from testing samples (see also Chapter 3 , 
Standard 3.6.2.2 ) (Evidence level C) ;
• Saline wash-back of residual red cells in the apheresis harness.
2.2.5.  Questionnaire and interview
Standards
2.2.5.1.  The questionnaire should be designed to elicit information relevant 
to the medical history, general health and other known or probable 
risk factors related to the donor. It should be designed to be 
understandable by the donor and given to all donors each time they 
attend. On completion, it should be signed by the donor (GPG 6.1.6.) .
2.2.5.2.  The donor interview must be conducted in such a way as to ensure 
confidentiality (Directive 2005/62/EC, Annex 6.1.2.) .
2.2.5.3.  The confidential interview should be conducted by specifically 
trained staff who may also ask further direct questions to supplement 
the information in the questionnaire. The person who carries out

--- PAGE BREAK ---
Chapter 2 Donor selection
135the assessment should certify that the relevant questions have been 
asked (GPG 6.1.9.) . 
2.2.5.4.  During the interview the donor should be evaluated for physical 
attributes, such as cyanosis, dyspnoea, undernutrition and 
intoxication from alcohol or drugs, that may suggest an underlying 
condition where donation is not safe. 
2.2.5.5.  Records of suitability and final assessment of donors must be signed 
by a qualified healthcare professional (Directive 2005/62/EC, Annex 
6.1.3.) .
The key topics for donor eligibility to be covered by the questionnaire 
or by direct questions, the intentions of the interview questions, and 
examples of sample questions are included in Appendix 1.
2.3. Donor deferral
2.3.1. General remarks
Donors with hazardous occupations or hobbies should be advised to 
wait for an interval of not less than 12 hours between donation and 
returning to the occupation or hobby. Examples of such hazardous 
occupations or hobbies include piloting, bus or train driving, crane 
operation, climbing of ladders or scaffolding, gliding, climbing and 
diving.
Donors presenting with a medical condition or under medical 
treatment should be assessed to determine their eligibility. Reasons 
for donor deferral may include non-infectious medical conditions, 
infectious diseases and medical or surgical treatments.
Standard
2.3.1.1.  Deferred individuals should be given a clear explanation of the 
reasons for deferral.

Guide to the preparation, use and quality assurance of blood components1362.3.2.  Non-infectious medical conditions
Standard
2.3.2.1.  Prospective donors with serious active, chronic or relapsing disease 
must be permanently deferred (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex III)
Allergy and anaphylaxis
Standard
2.3.2.2.  Donors with local/non ‑generalised allergic symptoms which are 
controlled with medication (except for oral corticosteroids or other 
immunosuppressive medical treatment) or without medication are 
accepted as donors (Evidence level C, E) .
2.3.2.3.  Donors who have had a recent episode of anaphylaxis or severe 
allergic reaction should be deferred for 2 weeks after recovery 
(Evidence level C, E) .
Donors with severe, widespread atopic eczema should be temporarily 
deferred until cessation of the symptoms (Evidence level C, E) .
Donors requiring oral corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressive 
medical treatment should be deferred temporarily until such 
treatment has stopped. Some treatments will also require a period of 
deferral post-cessation (Evidence level C, E) .
Donors with any known allergy to agents used in blood collection 
(skin disinfection agents, other material used in the collection process) 
should be deferred unless there is alternative material available 
(Evidence level E) . 
Based on current evidence, the major cause of anaphylaxis in a 
recipient is their own atopic condition and not transfusion-associated 
issues. Therefore, excluding donors based on their history of severe 
allergic/anaphylactic reactions is not an effective risk reduction 
strategy and may cause an unacceptable loss of donors. 
However, some case studies suggest that blood components with a 
higher volume of plasma from donors with recurrent severe allergic/

--- PAGE BREAK ---
Chapter 2 Donor selection
137anaphylactic reactions may carry a higher risk of anaphylaxis for 
the recipient. Therefore, consideration may be given to permanently 
deferring such donors from donating blood components with a high 
plasma volume, such as fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for clinical use and 
platelets in plasma (Evidence level E) . 
Autoimmune disease
A person requiring systemic immune-modulatory therapy should 
be deferred until such treatment has stopped. Asymptomatic donors 
without severe complications can be accepted.
Blood pressure
A person with a systolic blood pressure of 180 mm Hg or higher, 
or a diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or higher should be 
temporarily deferred. 
Cancer/malignant diseases
Standard
2.3.2.4.  Individuals with a malignant disease are permanently deferred, 
except donors with in situ carcinoma with complete recovery 
(Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex III) .
There is evidence to support the acceptance of donors with a history 
of cancer. Large observational studies have provided convincing 
evidence that the risk of transmitting cancer via blood transfusions is 
undetectable or not significant (Evidence level C) .
Therefore, the responsible physician may make exceptions other than 
in situ carcinoma if the donor has fully recovered with no expectation 
of recurrence (i.e. cured). 
The following conditions apply: 
• For cancers with negligible metastatic potential (e.g. basal cell 
carcinoma), the donor may be accepted following complete 
recovery. 
• For other cancers, at least 5 years should have elapsed since 
completion of treatment (Evidence level C, D, E) .

Cardiovascular disease
Standard
2.3.2.5.  Donors with active or past serious cardiovascular disease, except 
congenital abnormalities with complete cure, must be permanently 
deferred (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex III) .
2.3.2.6.  Persons with a history of coronary disease, angina pectoris, severe 
cardiac arrhythmia, a history of cerebrovascular diseases, arterial 
thrombosis or recurrent venous thrombosis should be classified 
as having ‘serious cardiovascular disease’ and therefore be 
permanently deferred (Evidence level E) .
Diabetes
Standard
2.3.2.7.  Donors with diabetes must be deferred if insulin therapy is required 
(Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex III) .
Epilepsy
Standard
2.3.2.8.  Donors with repeated episodes of syncope or a history of 
convulsions must be deferred until 3 years off treatment and free of 
attacks (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex III) .
Kidney disease
Standard
2.3.2.9.  Following acute glomerulonephritis donors should be deferred 
for 12 months after full recovery (feeling well, no treatment and 
discharged from specialist care).

Standard
2.3.2.10.  Pregnant donors must be deferred 6 months after delivery or 
termination. The responsible physician may make exceptions under 
exceptional circumstances (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex III) .
Pulse
A person with a pulse under 50 beats per minute (bpm), or above 
100 bpm or presenting with an irregular pulse should be deferred. 
Exceptions may be made to accept donors with a lower pulse rate 
following individual medical review, e.g. athletes.
Respiratory disease
Standard
2.3.2.11.  Prospective donors with serious active, chronic or relapsing 
respiratory system diseases must be permanently deferred (Directive 
2004/33/EC, Annex III) .
Rheumatic fever
Standard
2.3.2.12.  Donors suffering from rheumatic fever must be deferred for 2 years 
following the last attack or permanently if any evidence of chronic 
heart disease (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex III) .
Thalassaemia
Donors with thalassaemia should be deferred permanently if they are 
not in good health or if the haemoglobin levels are below acceptable 
values. Individuals with thalassaemia trait may give whole blood 
provided they are in good health and have a haemoglobin level within 
acceptable values. Platelet or plasma collection by apheresis is not 
recommended as the process may cause mechanical haemolysis.

Guide to the preparation, use and quality assurance of blood components1402.3.3.  Infectious diseases
Transmission of infectious agents by transfusion can be minimised 
by careful and appropriate use of donor questionnaires, laboratory 
testing and pathogen inactivation technologies (PIT).
Other measures are needed for infections where there is a possibility 
of asymptomatic infection or existence of a carrier state. Questioning 
donors about symptoms in these circumstances does not always 
prevent transmission.
Donors should be questioned on their risk of exposure to infectious 
agents, which includes taking a travel history:
• For infections in which the agent has been fully cleared from 
the donor’s blood on recovery, the donor should be deferred 
from donation until they are no longer infectious (usually 2 
weeks from cessation of symptoms);
• In cases of known contact with an infectious agent, the donor 
should be deferred for approximately twice the length of the 
incubation period. In case of a geographical risk of exposure to 
multiple infectious agents, the longest deferral period applies;
• Many infections that can be transmitted by transfusion 
have defined geographical limits, and the risk of transfusion 
transmission can be minimised by temporary deferral or 
testing donors travelling from affected areas. Testing becomes 
especially relevant when deferral policies may potentially affect 
supply.
Blood services should maintain a watching brief on changes to risks 
of infectious diseases worldwide. Risk-benefit analyses should be 
carried out to determine appropriate measures to decrease the risks 
of transfusion transmission. The risk of importation of an infectious 
agent through donors visiting an affected area should be balanced 
by considering the likelihood of this occurring, and the impact of 
introducing a new donor deferral ruling on blood supply. This risk 
will vary between countries.

Chapter 2 Donor selection
141New and emerging infectious agents or those that have moved to 
infect a new geographical area can also pose a significant challenge to 
donor availability or blood component safety. In this situation, donor 
deferral may not be an option in the newly affected area. Donation 
testing is an important tool to reduce the risk of transmission. For 
plasma and platelets, PIT may also be considered.
Information about new and emerging infections should be 
communicated between countries without delay to allow blood 
establishments to consider their own risks and appropriate actions.
Babesiosis
Standard
2.3.3.1.  Donors with babesiosis must be deferred permanently (Directive 
2004/33/EC, Annex III) .
Deferral requirements may be waived if the donation is used 
exclusively for plasma for fractionation.
Brucellosis
Standard
2.3.3.2.  Donors with brucellosis must be deferred for at least 2 years 
following full recovery (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex III)
Deferral requirements may be waived if the donation is used 
exclusively for plasma for fractionation.
Chikungunya virus
Standards
2.3.3.3.  Donors visiting regions endemic for chikungunya virus infections 
should be deferred for 28 days after leaving the risk area.
Deferral requirements may be waived if the donation is used 
exclusively for plasma for fractionation.
2.3.3.4.  Donors suffering from chikungunya virus infections should be 
deferred for 120 days after resolution of the symptoms.

Guide to the preparation, use and quality assurance of blood components142Common cold
Donors presenting with the common cold should be deferred until 
cessation of symptoms.
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease
Standards
2.3.3.5.  Individuals who have been treated with extracts derived from 
human pituitary glands and recipients of dura mater  or corneal 
grafts must be deferred permanently (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex III) .
2.3.3.6.  Individuals with a family risk of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) 
or any other transmissible spongiform encephalopathy must be 
deferred permanently (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex III) .
A family history of CJD carries a presumption of family risk unless it 
is determined that:
• The affected family member had vCJD, not CJD; or
• The affected family member did not have a genetic relationship 
to the donor; or
• The cause of CJD in the affected family member was iatrogenic; 
or
• The donor was tested and is known to have a normal genetic 
polymorphism for PrPc.
Standard
2.3.3.7.  Deferral of donors as a preventative measure for vCJD should be 
based on appropriate risk assessment.
Variant CJD (vCJD) was first described in the UK in 1996. Estimating 
the potential size of the vCJD epidemic has been very difficult. 
Transfusion transmission of vCJD has been documented in animal 
studies and in humans. Endogenous risk of vCJD differs between 
countries. Therefore, the need for different measures to reduce risk 
will depend on each country’s own risk assessment, balancing risk 
with sufficiency of supply.

143Many countries outside the UK defer donors who have lived in the UK 
for a minimum defined period between 1980 and 1996; the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) mandates 1 year of UK residence for donors 
of plasma for fractionation. In some instances, the deferrals have been 
extended to include donors from other countries with a significant 
number of cases.

transfusion-transmissible infection (TTI) disease prevalence and 
incidence, modifications to standard 2.3.4.1. can be accepted for 
acupuncture, tattooing, body piercing or skin/mucosa-penetrating 
aesthetic medical procedures. These may be implemented nationally 
or by decision of the responsible physician (Evidence level C, E) .

151Medication
Standard
2.3.4.6.  Donors treated with drugs with proven teratogenic effect must be 
deferred for a period at least consistent with the pharmacokinetic 
properties of the drug.
The taking of a medication may indicate an underlying disease which 
may disqualify the donor. It is recommended that a list of commonly 
used drugs, with rules for acceptability of donors, approved by the 
medical staff of the blood establishment, be made available.
Surgery
Standard
2.3.4.7.  After major surgery, donors must be deferred for 6 months (or 4 
months provided a NAT test for hepatitis C is negative) (Directive 
2004/33/EC, Annex III) .
2.3.4.8.  After minor surgery, donors must be deferred for 1 week (Directive 
2004/33/EC, Annex III) .
There is no clear evidence to specifically support the deferral periods 
of 4 to 6 months after major surgery and 1 week after minor surgery 
(Evidence level C, E) . By using a risk-based approach, modifications 
to standards 2.3.4.7. and 2.3.4.8. can be accepted and implemented 
nationally or by decision of the responsible physician. 
Where modified standards are implemented, the following should be 
considered when assessing eligibility of such donors: 
• For major surgery: persons should not donate until they have 
fully recovered (which may be up to 6 months or longer). A 
shorter deferral period is possible after clinical evaluation, if 
the donor has totally recovered from the surgery (i.e. wound 
healed, no signs of postoperative infection and in a healthy 
condition) (Evidence level C, E) .

Guide to the preparation, use and quality assurance of blood components152• For planned major surgery: allogeneic whole blood donation 
should be avoided for an appropriate time interval before major 
surgery (Evidence level, E) .
• For minor surgery: deferral until wound healed (stitches 
removed, no signs of infection) (Evidence level C, E) .
When considering revised donor eligibility following surgery, the 
responsible physician should take into consideration the following:
• The indication for the surgery;
• Whether the donor received a transfusion of labile blood 
products; if so, refer to specific rules;
• The need to measure the haemoglobin level pre-donation after 
major surgery.
Dental care/Oral health care
Standard
2.3.4.9.  Individuals must be deferred for 1 week after tooth extraction, root 
filling and similar treatments (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex III) .
2.3.4.10.  Donors undergoing minor treatment by a dentist or dental hygienist 
must be deferred until the next day (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex III) .
The available evidence indicates that bacteraemia immediately 
following minor dental treatments is transient, lasting only up to 30 
minutes. Poor oral health, such as acute or chronic gingivitis, is a 
risk factor for bacteraemia (Evidence level C) . By using a risk-based 
approach, modifications to standard 2.3.4.10. can be accepted and 
implemented nationally or by decision of the responsible physician.
Modifications to the standard can be made by the responsible 
physician as follows: 
• Minor dental treatment by the dentist or dental hygienist: 60 
minutes’ deferral (Evidence level C, E) ;
• Acute oral infection (e.g. gingivitis requiring treatment): defer 
until cessation and/or 2 weeks after completion of oral course 
of antibiotics (Evidence level C, E) .

C is negative) (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex III) .
Injection of red cells as part of an approved immunisation programme 
will need clinical assessment.
Blood or blood components used for treatment other than transfusion
Donors who have received treatment with allogeneic blood or blood 
components for topical use or injections should be treated as though 
they had received blood components for transfusion (Evidence level C, 
E).

Standards
2.3.4.12.  After vaccination with attenuated bacteria and viruses, e.g. BCG, 
yellow fever, rubella, measles, poliomyelitis (oral), mumps, live 
attenuated typhoid fever, vaccinia, live attenuated cholera vaccine, 
individuals must be deferred for 4 weeks (Directive 2004/33/EC,

2.4. Specific standards for donors of different types of 
components
Below are specific standards for donors of blood and blood 
components for both whole blood and apheresis collection. The 
intervals between donations are provided in Table  2-3 at the end of the 
chapter. 
2.4.1.  Whole blood donation
Volume of whole blood donation
Standards
2.4.1.1.  A standard donation of whole blood must not be collected from 
persons weighing less than 50 kg (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex III) .
2.4.1.2.  The volume of a standard donation of whole blood (excluding 
anticoagulants) should not exceed 500 mL and usually consists of 
a donation of 450 mL ± 10 %. This does not include any allowance

155for samples taken for laboratory tests and for retention of a donor 
sample.
2.4.1.3.  The volume of a standard donation of whole blood (including 
samples) should not exceed 15 % of the calculated blood volume of 
the donor.
The total blood volume (TBV) of the donor can be estimated 
from their weight, height and sex using a validated formula. The 
estimates developed by the International Council for Standardization 
in Haematology (ICSH) are recommended and are available in 
Appendix 2 .
It is generally accepted that all males weighing ≥ 50 kg have a 
sufficiently large blood volume to donate a total 535 mL of blood 
(500 mL plus 35 mL for testing and retention of a donation sample), 
while all females weighing ≥ 50 kg have a sufficiently large blood 
volume to donate a total 485 mL of blood (450 mL plus 35 mL for 
testing and retention of a donation sample).
In the case of females weighing < 65 kg and donating a total of 
>485 mL, the blood volume should be estimated. This volume should 
exceed the minimum acceptable blood volume for the volume of 
blood to be collected (see Table 2-2).

Guide to the preparation, use and quality assurance of blood components156Frequency of whole blood donation
Standards
2.4.1.4.  A maximum of 6 standard donations of whole blood per year can 
be taken from male and up to 4 per year from female donors with a 
minimum interval between standard donations of 8 weeks.
2.4.1.5.  These maximum limits of donation frequency should never be 
exceeded and should only be adopted after careful consideration of 
the dietary habits of the population concerned and in the knowledge 
that extra care may be necessary, beyond routine haemoglobin 
or haematocrit estimation, in the monitoring of donors for iron 
deficiency.
It is therefore recommended that an active donor panel of sufficient 
size be maintained to allow donors to be bled less often than the 
maximum annual rates.
2.4.2.  Apheresis donation
Donors should be informed of the risks associated with the apheresis 
procedure and consent should be obtained before each donation. 
Standards
2.4.2.1.  The medical supervision and care of apheresis donors should be the 
responsibility of a physician specially trained in these techniques.
2.4.2.2.  Other than in exceptional circumstances (to be decided by the 
responsible physician), donors for apheresis procedures should 
meet the criteria for whole blood donations unless otherwise 
identified in this Guide.
The impact of prematurely terminated apheresis procedures, including 
consideration of a failed return of red cells resulting in a red cell 
loss and the amount of primary component already collected, needs 
to be taken into account when determining compliance with these 
requirements.

Chapter 2 Donor selection
157There are concerns about long-term effects in donors in intensive 
apheresis programmes. These include risks associated with citrate 
exposure in regular platelet apheresis donors, which might lead to 
problems with bone mineral density and reduced IgG levels. Regular 
monitoring of IgG in plasmapheresis donors for adjusting of donation 
frequency has been shown to improve donor safety.
Special attention should be given to the following conditions:
• Abnormal bleeding episodes;
• Adverse reactions to previous donations;
• Frequency of donation and maximal amounts of plasma and 
red cells to be collected.
Standards
2.4.2.3.  The interval between one plasmapheresis or plateletpheresis 
procedure and a donation of whole blood or apheresis procedure 
incorporating collection of a single or double unit of red cells 
(whereby one unit is equivalent to a red cell component obtained 
from one whole blood donation) should be at least 48 hours.
2.4.2.4.  The interval between a whole blood donation, an apheresis red cell 
collection or a failed return of red cells during apheresis, and the 
next apheresis procedure without red cell collection should be at 
least 4 weeks.
2.4.2.5.  The interval between two single‑unit red cell collections should be 
the same as for collections of whole blood.
Additional requirements for donors undergoing plasmapheresis
Sampling and residual blood remaining in the plasmapheresis devices 
can result in a non-negligible loss of red cells, with a consequent 
reduction in serum iron and ferritin. This is especially important for 
female donors.
Where frequent plasmapheresis is undertaken, consideration should 
be given to the implementation of measures to reduce residual blood 
loss in the equipment, e.g. post-procedure saline infusion. Loss of iron

Guide to the preparation, use and quality assurance of blood components158in donors can also be mitigated by using samples from the plasma 
collection container (instead of whole blood samples) for mandatory 
laboratory screening tests (see also Chapter 3 , Standard 3.6.2.2 , 
Evidence level C).
The following standards identify requirements for donors undergoing 
plasmapheresis.
Standards
2.4.2.6.  The maximum number of plasma donations allowed is 33 per year 
(Evidence level C) .
2.4.2.7.  The collection volume for each plasmapheresis should be based on 
estimation of an allowed/permitted volume for an individual donor. 
The limits for allowed volumes should be based on estimated TBV 
and/or body mass index (BMI) and can be set either by national/
regional regulations or based on TBV estimation in Appendix 2a  or 
BMI in Appendix 2b .
2.4.2.8.  The collection volume for each plasmapheresis (including 
anticoagulant) should never exceed 880 mL.
2.4.2.9.  When the collection volume (including anticoagulant) is determined 
by the estimation of TBV (Appendix 2a) the donated volume 
(excluding anticoagulant) should not exceed 16 % of the estimated 
TBV and in any type of apheresis procedure the total volume of all 
components donated (plasma, platelets and red cells) should not 
exceed 16 % of the estimated TBV.
2.4.2.10.  The donation interval should be at least 1 week (see the IgG algorithm 
provided below).
2.4.2.11.  Haemoglobin values at plasmapheresis donation should not be less 
than 120 g/L or 7.5 mmol/L for female and not less than 130 g/L or 
8.1 mmol/L for male donors.

Chapter 2 Donor selection
159Individual donations may be accepted below these levels after 
consultation with the responsible physician or as established by a 
competent authority based on norms for their specific populations.
2.4.2.12.  Total proteins must be measured at least annually and must not be 
less than 60 g/L (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex III) .
2.4.2.13.  IgG levels should be within local population reference ranges and 
should not fall below 6.0 g/L.
2.4.2.14.  IgG should be measured at least annually and at every 26th donation, 
whichever comes first (Evidence level C, E) .
The maximum donation frequency for an individual donor should be 
guided by the results of the testing. An approach for the calculation of 
the maximum donation frequency for an individual donor based on 
their IgG levels could be as follows:
• IgG < 6.0 g/L results in a deferral from plasmapheresis of at 
least 3 weeks. Repeated measurements of < 6.0 g/L should lead 
to either a significant increase in the inter-donation interval or 
permanent deferral from plasmapheresis;
• IgG 6.0–8.0 g/L supports donations with a minimum interval 
of 2 weeks;
• IgG > 8.0g/L supports donations with a minimum interval of 
1 week.
Additional requirements for donors undergoing platelet apheresis
Standards
2.4.2.15.  Platelet apheresis must not be carried out on individuals whose 
platelet count is less than 150 × 109/L (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex III) .
2.4.2.16.  Haemoglobin values at plateletpheresis donation must not be less 
than 125 g/L or 7.8 mmol/L for female and not less than 135 g/L or 
8.4 mmol/L for male donors (Directive 2004/33/EC, Annex III) .

2.4.2.17.  Donors should not be subjected to a plateletpheresis procedure 
more often than once every 2 weeks.
An exception to the donation interval and platelet count may be made 
in the case of HLA-/HPA-matched donations and for IgA-negative 
donors at the discretion of the physician.
Additional requirements for donors undergoing double unit red cell 
apheresis
Standards
2.4.2.18.  Minimum limits for haemoglobin values at double unit red cell 
apheresis donation should not be less than 140 g/L or 8.7 mmol/L for 
both female and male donors.
2.4.2.19.  The total amount of red cells collected should not exceed the 
theoretical amount of red cells that would reduce the donor 
haemoglobin level, in an isovolemic situation, to below 110 g/L (6.8 
mmol/L).
2.4.2.20.  The donor should have an estimated blood volume of > 4.5 L which 
must be calculated on the basis of sex, height and weight (see 
Appendix 2a , Tables 1 and 2).
2.4.2.21.  The interval following a whole blood donation and the subsequent 
donation of a double unit of red cells should be at least 12 weeks. The 
interval following a double unit red cell apheresis and a subsequent 
whole blood donation or double unit red cell apheresis should be at 
least 24 weeks for female  and 16 weeks for male donors.
2.4.2.22.  The maximum volume of red cells collected should not exceed 
400 mL (without resuspension solution) per collection procedure.
2.4.2.23.  Total red cell volume collected per year should not exceed that 
acceptable for whole blood donors.

161Additional recommendations for granulocytapheresis
Clinical efficacy, indications and dosage of granulocyte transfusion 
have not been established. In view of this, provision of informed 
consent prior to collection of granulocytes is particularly important. 
Effective granulocyte collection involves administration of medication 
(corticosteroids and/or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) to 
increase circulating granulocyte levels and the use of sedimenting 
agents (hydroxyethyl starch; HES) during the procedure itself. Both of 
these have potentially severe side-effects, identified below, that need to 
be communicated to the donor.
HES acts as a volume expander. Donors who have received HES may 
experience headaches or peripheral oedema because of expanded 
circulatory volume. HES may accumulate, which can result in 
pruritus, and allergic reactions are possible.
Corticosteroids may cause, for example, hypertension, diabetes 
mellitus, cataracts, peptic ulcer and psychiatric problems.
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF): the most common 
short-term complication following G-CSF administration in 
peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) donors is bone pain; although, 
on very rare occasions, splenic rupture or lung injury may occur. 
Concerns have also been raised relating to the development of acute 
myeloid leukaemia (AML)/myelodysplasia (MDS) after G-CSF 
administration. To date, however, registry data from Europe and 
the USA have not identified any increased risk of AML/MDS in 
healthy individuals who donated PBSCs and received G-CSF as a 
pretreatment. The median follow-up of these studies is, however, less 
than 5 years. Therefore, if G-CSF is given to a donor, a protocol for 
long-term follow-up should be in place.
Additional recommendations for donors of red cells for anti-RhD 
immunisation
Specific protocols for donors of red cells for anti-RhD immunisation 
should be in place and should at least include the following:

Guide to the preparation, use and quality assurance of blood components162• Additional testing for markers of infectious disease, such 
as anti-  HTLV-1/2, anti-HBc and NAT tests for pro-viral 
HIV-DNA and HIV-RNA, antibodies against HCV-RNA, 
HBV-DNA, parvovirus B19 DNA or parvovirus B19 antibodies, 
H AV-R NA;
• Extensive red cell phenotyping should be performed at least 
twice, and may be supplemented by genotyping;
• The red cells for immunisation should be stored for at least 
6 months. After 6 months, all the infectious markers stated 
above should have been found to be negative (or indicate 
absence of infection) on a new donor sample before release of 
the stored red cells for immunisation.
In order to manage the impact of changes in donor selection criteria 
and infectious marker testing that may occur over time, protocols 
should require:
• Maintenance of retention samples from each donation suitable 
for future testing;
• Requalification of past donations by assessing conformance 
with additional donor acceptance requirements, including, 
where appropriate, testing of the donor and/or the retention 
sample. 
Exemption of past donations from current standards is not 
recommended and should only be considered in exceptional 
circumstances after careful consideration of the risks to the 
immunised donors and ultimate plasma product recipients.
2.4.3.  Designated donations
Although blood donation is voluntary, non-remunerated and 
anonymous, in some special circumstances it may be necessary to 
make use of designated donations. This should happen only for clear 
medical indications. Designated donors should be screened and tested 
like volunteer allogeneic donors.

Chapter 2 Donor selection
163Designated donations are those intended for named patients based on 
medical indications. Circumstances where designated donations may 
be indicated include:
• Patients with rare blood types, where no compatible 
anonymous donations are available;
• Where donor-specific transfusions are indicated for 
immune modulation or immunotherapy; for instance, in 
the preparation procedure for kidney transplants or for 
lymphocyte transfusions aimed at a graft-versus-leukaemia 
effect;
• In certain cases of alloimmune neonatal thrombocytopaenia; 
for instance, if HPA-typed platelets are not available and 
intravenous immunoglobulin therapy is not sufficient.
These donations may involve family members, in which case the 
responsible physician should weigh up the risks and benefits for the 
patient.
The practice of transfusing parental blood to infants is not without 
risk. Mothers may have antibodies to antigens that are present on 
the infant’s red blood cells, platelets or white blood cells. Therefore, 
maternal plasma should not be transfused. Fathers should not serve 
as cell donors to neonates because maternal antibodies to antigens 
inherited from the father may have been transmitted through the 
placenta to the foetus. In addition, due to partial histocompatibility, 
transfusions of cells from parental or family donors carry an 
increased risk of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease 
(TA-GVHD), even in the immunocompetent recipient, and so such 
components should be irradiated. In the case of platelets, PIT for 
components may be used as an alternative to irradiation.
2.4.4.  Directed donations
Directed donations are those intended for named patients, where 
the request for the donation has been made by patients, relatives or 
friends. The public often believes that directed donations are safer 
than anonymous, voluntary, non-remunerated donations. However, 
Blood21.indb   163Blood21.indb   163 04/04/2023   09:26:0104/04/2023   09:26:01
--- PAGE BREAK ---
Guide to the preparation, use and quality assurance of blood components164this is not the case, even if directed donations are screened and tested 
in the same manner as voluntary non-remunerated donations.
Directed donations are not considered good practice and should be 
discouraged.
2.5. Post-donation information
2.5.1. Overview
Blood establishments often receive information from blood donors 
after donation that should have resulted in their deferral and may 
attempt to retrieve distributed blood components that did not meet all 
quality standards and regulations.
Post-donation information (PDI) is largely a reflection of the inherent 
limitations of the current donor screening process, which uses broad, 
precautionary questions to guard against theoretical or extremely 
remote risks. Consequently, PDI is an important measure of the 
accuracy of donor suitability assessment and compliance with good 
practice.
2.5.2.  Donor instruction
Standard
2.5.2.1.  Donors should be instructed to inform the blood establishment 
about any relevant information that was not previously disclosed or 
if signs or symptoms occur after a donation. This scenario indicates 
that the donation may have been infectious or that any other 
information not disclosed during the health screening may render 
prior donations unsuitable for transfusion (GPG 6.1.12) .
PDI includes information provided by the donor or other source and 
received by telephone or other means of communication following a 
donation. Blood establishments should evaluate PDI that is revealed 
by a third party without the donor’s knowledge, weighing the 
reliability of the source of the information against the direct responses 
from the donor.

1652.5.3.  Control procedures
Systems should be in place to define the actions to be taken if a donor 
informs the blood establishment that he/she previously donated blood 
but should not have done so in the light of donor selection criteria.
Blood establishments should have control procedures that provide 
for the receipt and documentation of PDI reports that identify the 
source of the information (e.g. from a donor or qualified healthcare 
professional).
Blood establishments should have control procedures that provide 
for the prompt medical evaluation by a qualified physician, following 
established criteria, to ensure that potential risks are consistently 
assessed and investigated for all donations potentially affected.
Blood establishments should have control procedures that provide 
for appropriate consignee notification and determination of the 
disposition of all affected products (in-date and expired), including 
those intended for transfusion and those intended for further 
manufacturing use where the quality of the final manufactured 
product may be compromised.
Blood establishments should have control procedures that provide for 
assessment of the donor’s suitability to serve as a donor in the future.
